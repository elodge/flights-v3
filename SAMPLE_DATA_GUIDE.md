- ✅ **Automatic redirects**: Users redirected if trying to access unauthorized data

## 🧪 **Testing Setup Instructions**

### **1. Create Test Users**
Go to your Supabase dashboard and create test users in Authentication:

**Test Client User:**
- Email: `client@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Test Agent User:**
- Email: `agent@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

### **2. Set User Roles**
Update the user roles in the database:

```sql
-- Set client role
UPDATE users SET role = 'client' WHERE email = 'client@test.com';

-- Set agent role  
UPDATE users SET role = 'agent' WHERE email = 'agent@test.com';
```

### **3. Assign Client to Artist**
Create an artist assignment to give the client access to Taylor Swift's projects:

```sql
-- Get the client user ID
SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = 'client@test.com';

-- Assign client to Taylor Swift (replace CLIENT_USER_ID with actual ID)
INSERT INTO artist_assignments (user_id, artist_id) 
VALUES ('CLIENT_USER_ID', '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111');
```

### **4. Verification Tests**
